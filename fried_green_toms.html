    <h2>Southern Fried Green Tomatoes</h2>
    <p>
        Ripe red tomatoes sandwiched between slices of white bread is the quintessential taste of summer. But if you're
        only eating ruby-hued tomatoes, look to the South to find summer's unsung hero. Stubbornly unripe green tomatoes
        take a dip in tangy buttermilk, are breaded in cornmeal coating, and then fried until golden in a slick of hot
        oil. It's time to try this easy Southern specialty at home.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup instant flour divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg white</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons hot sauce, such as Louisiana or Tabasco</li>
        <li>3/4 cup finely ground cornmeal</li>
        <li>3 unripe green tomatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds total), cut into 1/4-inch thick slices</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Season the flour: </strong>Stir 1/3 cup of the flour, salt, and paprika together in a wide, shallow
            bowl or pie plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the wet mixture: </strong>Whisk the buttermilk, egg white, and hot sauce together in second
            wide, shallow bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the cornmeal: </strong>Stir the cornmeal and remaining 1/3 cup flour together in a third
            wide, shallow bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bread the tomato slices: </strong>Fit a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Dip each tomato
            slice in the flour mixture, followed by the buttermilk mixture, and finally the cornmeal mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Set the cornmeal coating: </strong>Place the breaded tomato slices on the rack in a single layer.
            Let sit so the coating sets while the oil heats.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Heat the oil: </strong>Heat the oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until
            shimmering, about 5 minutes. The oil should sizzle immediately if you sprinkle flour into it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fry the tomatoes: </strong>Carefully add 4 to 5 tomato slices and fry until golden-brown, 3 to 5
            minutes per side. Transer the fried tomatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Fry the remaining tomato slices.
        </li>
    </ol>
