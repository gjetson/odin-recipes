        <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese shredded</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian herb blend</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon (each) salt & black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Slice eggplant:</strong> remove stem from eggplant then slice into 1/4-1/2 inch thick slices.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sweat eggplant:</strong> arrange slices on a pan and sprinkle with a pinch of coarse salt on both
            sides. Let sit and
            "sweat" excess moisture for 10 minutes. Pat firmly with paper towels to dry eggplant thoroughly (wipe off
            salt as well).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Breadcrumbs:</strong> toast slices of bread. Then chop in food processor until consistency is
            crumbs. Mix breadcrumbs
            in a bowl with garlic powder, salt & pepper, Italian herbs, and shredded parmesan cheese.
            <p>
                <strong>Tip:</strong> If you are not making your own breadcrumbs, use 1 1/2 cups of store-bought
                breadcrumbs instead.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bread eggplant:</strong> arrange three bowls containing whisked eggs, flour, and breadcrumb mixture.
            First, coat eggplant in flour on both sides, then dip into eggs, and then dip into breadcrumbs – pack onto
            eggplant and then gently shake off excess crumbs. Wipe hands with paper towel then repeat. Tip: if baking
            eggplant instead of frying, brush a sheet pan with 1-2 Tablespoons of oil and arrange breaded eggplant onto
            pan as you coat them.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pan frying method:</strong> in a skillet pan, add 1-2 Tablespoons of oil at a time, and cook
            breaded eggplant for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Lay on paper towels to soak up excess
            oil. Repeat until all eggplant has been fried.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble:</strong> in a large casserole dish, spread a generous layer of marinara on the bottom.
            Then layer: eggplant slices, mozzarella, a spoonful of marinara, and shredded parmesan. Repeat an additional
            layer (breaded eggplant, mozzarella, marinara, and shredded parmesan).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake:</strong> Then bake at 400F uncovered for 30 minutes until cheese is browned and melted. Top
            with chopped fresh basil & oregano, and serve!
